# Help-the-helpers
This project was developed during the 24 hours Hack-A-Thon (Err_404 Hack Not Found) organized by Saboo Siddik College Of Engineering. The problem statement given to us was to solve the various problems of the various NGO's using Technology. The major problems include Volunteer Management, Fund Raising, Attracting Volunteers, Event Management, etc.

For encouraging the volunteers, donors we maintained a leaderboard for both. Scrape the data from Social media and suggested the events to the user based on their personal interests. A dashboard was maintained for volunteers, donors to keep them updated about their upcoming events, certificates and receipts which can help them to get some exemption from taxes coz of their good work to the society. A chat system was provided for direct interaction between the different NGOs, between NGOs and Volunteers. A video chat system was provided to directly interact with the admin of the website and ask for some feature.
